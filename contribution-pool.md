# Auction Contribution Pool (Pooling)

The Contribution Pool allows multiple smaller users to team up to seize a flag.

- Minimum contribution: **0.01 SOL**
- If the pool fails to reach the seize price: **full refund**, no penalty
- If the pool wins: rewards are shared **pro‑rata** by contribution

## Why this helps
- Lets communities coordinate against large wallets
- Adds social gameplay and coordination meta
